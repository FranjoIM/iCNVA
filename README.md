# iCNVA: An Integrated CNV Analysis Pipeline

iCNVA is an integratad CNV analysis pipeline, intended for a seamless analysis workflow from Illumina final report stage to phenotype association analysis. The analysis integrates MarkerMatch algorithm ([@FranjoIM](https://github.com/FranjoIM))<sup>1</sup> with ensemblCNV<sup>2</sup>, PennCNV<sup>3</sup>, QuantiSNP<sup>4</sup>, iPattern<sup>5</sup>, FRAPOSA<sup>6</sup>, and Slurm scheduler to run the analaysis of copy-number variation with respect to a case-control phenotype.

## Marker Match
If batches were genotyped on different arrays, run marker match on array manifests to get concensus markers for CNV analysis. 

## Sample Clustering
Cluster samples in Illumina GenomeStudio.
